# Global Telangana Association - Detroit Chapter 

Welcome to the official repository for the Global Telangana Association (GTA) Detroit Chapter website. This platform serves to connect the Telangana community in Detroit, share event updates, and provide resources for our members.

## 🚀 Built With AI

This project was built entirely using **Google's Antigravity (Agentic AI)** and **Gemini**.

*   **Antigravity**: An advanced agentic coding assistant that navigated the codebase, executed terminal commands, and managed the development lifecycle.
*   **Gemini**: The powerful multimodal AI model that generated the code, content, and design strategies.

This repository stands as a testament to the power of AI-driven development, where human creativity meets machine efficiency to build meaningful community software.
